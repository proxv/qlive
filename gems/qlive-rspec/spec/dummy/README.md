# Dummy App

I randomly grabbed a demo app that uses rails and backbone:
https://github.com/mulderp/Backbone-on-Rails-todoDemo


## Run dummy app qlive suites in browser
```
cd qlive/gems/qlive-rspec/spec/dummy
rails s
http://localhost/qlive
```

## Run dummy app qlive suites headlessly
```
rspec spec/qunits
```
